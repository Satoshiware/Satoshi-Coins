500K Coin 7-Bit Ascii:
    "I Am Satoshi"
    Note: It can be more easily deciphered by copying the text from the artwork
    and removing the capital ‘O’ characters and the ‘-’ character. These were
    added to smooth out the formatting on the coin. Also, the
    first 500k coin die had a '0' for a '1' in the upper right corner.

10K Coin Elvish Text:
